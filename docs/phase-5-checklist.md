- [ ] **10.5** Validate file type and size restrictions
- [ ] **10.6** Test bulk operations thoroughly

## Key User Stories Addressed

### US-06: Upload PNG image files with transparent backgrounds into project
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Users can drag and drop PNG files into the interface
  - Only PNG files with transparency are accepted
  - Files are validated for format and size before upload
  - Upload progress is clearly indicated
  - Successfully uploaded assets appear in the asset gallery

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Components
- `AssetUploader` - Drag-and-drop upload zone
- `AssetGallery` - Thumbnail grid display
- `AssetCard` - Individual asset display component
- `AssetPreview` - Modal for asset preview
- `AssetManager` - Bulk operations interface
- `AssetSearch` - Search and filter components

### Backend Integration
- Use existing asset endpoints from Phase 3:
  - `GET /api/projects/:id/assets` - List project assets
  - `POST /api/projects/:id/assets` - Upload asset
  - `DELETE /api/assets/:id` - Delete asset
  - `GET /api/assets/*` - Serve asset files

### API Service Layer
- `assetService.ts` - API calls for asset operations
- Asset upload with progress tracking
- Asset metadata management
- Error handling and retry logic

### State Management
- Asset list state management
- Upload progress tracking
- Selection state for bulk operations
- Search and filter state

## Dependencies
- React-dropzone for drag-and-drop functionality
- Sharp or similar for image processing (if needed client-side)
- File type validation libraries
- Progress tracking utilities

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Seamless drag-and-drop upload experience
- [ ] Fast and responsive asset gallery
- [ ] Intuitive asset management operations
- [ ] Robust file validation and error handling
- [ ] Smooth integration with existing project workflow
- [ ] High performance with large numbers of assets

## Phase Completion Requirements
- All deliverables implemented and tested
- Integration with existing Phase 4 project management
- Ready for Phase 6 3D Canvas integration
- Comprehensive documentation updated
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
