# Phase 2: Authentication & Basic UI Layout Enhancement - Checklist

## Overview
Phase 2 focuses on implementing authentication system and enhancing the basic UI layout. This phase builds upon the Phase 1 foundation and addresses **US-01** (Login with predefined credentials) and **US-04** (Edit/View mode toggle).

## Phase 2 Deliverables Checklist

### 🔐 Authentication System
- [x] Create authentication types and interfaces
- [x] Implement simple login form with email/password validation
- [x] Set up hardcoded credentials for MVP (US-01 requirement)
- [x] Create session management with cookies/localStorage
- [x] Implement protected routes middleware
- [x] Add logout functionality
- [x] Create authentication context/state management

### 🎨 UI Layout Enhancement
- [x] Enhance Header component with user context
- [x] Create login page with proper styling
- [x] Add project dashboard/home page
- [x] Implement Edit/View mode toggle functionality (US-04)
- [x] Add hover states and improved interactions
- [x] Create modal/dialog components for future use
- [x] Enhance responsive design

### 🔧 State Management & Error Handling
- [x] Set up state management (Context API or Zustand)
- [x] Add loading states for authentication
- [x] Implement error handling for login failures
- [x] Add form validation for login form

### 🧪 Testing & Validation
- [x] Test authentication flow works correctly
- [x] Test protected routes redirect properly
- [x] Test logout functionality
- [x] Test Edit/View mode toggle
- [x] Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Key User Stories Addressed

### US-01: Login with predefined credentials to access dashboard
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Simple login form with email/password fields
- Hardcoded credentials validation
- Successful login redirects to dashboard
- Session persistence across browser refresh

### US-04: Toggle between Edit Mode and View Mode
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Toggle button/switch in the UI
- Edit mode shows all editing tools and panels
- View mode hides editing tools for clean preview
- Mode state persists during session

## Authentication Requirements

### Hardcoded Credentials (MVP)
```typescript
const PREDEFINED_CREDENTIALS = {
  email: "admin@scrapyuk.com",
  password: "scrapyuk2024"
}
```

### Session Management
- Use HTTP-only cookies for security
- Fallback to localStorage for client-side state
- Session timeout after 24 hours
- Automatic refresh on valid session

### Protected Routes
- `/dashboard` - requires authentication
- `/projects/*` - requires authentication
- `/` (root) - redirects to dashboard if authenticated, otherwise to login

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Authentication Flow
1. User visits protected route
2. Check for valid session
3. If no session, redirect to `/login`
4. User enters credentials
5. Validate against hardcoded credentials
6. Set session cookie/localStorage
7. Redirect to intended destination
